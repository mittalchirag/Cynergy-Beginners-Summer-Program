# Task 2: Chatbot

Note: Before starting this task, read the full README (I've dropped some hints).

This assignment has two tasks: Task 2A and Task 2B

## Task 2A

You need to answer the following questions and document them in markdown format:

**Questions:**

1. Difference between C and C++

2. What is this operator(`::`) in C++ and What is it's use?

3. Are C++ strings mutable or immutable?

4. What are namespaces in C++ and their use?

5. Write a program in C++ to print the following pattern:

   ```
       *
      ***
     *****
    *******
   *********
   ```

6. Why do you think C++ is the right choice to begin programming?

## Task 2B

A chatbot is a very basic program and one of the first program created by many famous programmers (Richard Stallman) to begin their coding journey. A chatbot is a program which takes a string or a phrase in natural language (like English) and responds to that phrase.

Your task is to make a **simple chatbot in C++** which when given an English phrase, responds to it "appropriately". 

After this task you should have knowledge of these programming concepts:

- Basics of programming - statements, terminators, external files
- Variables, Constants
- Data types - Strings
- Input/Output
- Mathematical Operations
- Types of errors
- Basic Programming in C++

*Using the above concepts only, you could be able to complete the task. (You can use other concepts too)*

It is not required to make a full-fledged chatbot, it can be as simple as taking a string as input and giving some other string as output. The bare minimum to complete this task is that your chatbot should respond to the following queries:

1. What is your name?
2. Which day is today?
3. What is 2+2?
4. Who is your creator?
5. When is the next match of India?
6. What more can you do?

You need to document your code properly and explain your design approach and solution with images and code snippets. (Extra marks for creativity). 

*Please note that you have to use Markdown Format for documentation*

## Instructions

- Answer the question given in task 2A and document the file in Markdown format. Save the file with name `Task2A.md`
- You need to submit your **commented** code as a single `chatbot.cpp` file with **documentation**. You can be as explanative and creative in the documentation. You can even extend the functionality of the bot (as you like) but to pass this task your bot should answer the bare minimum queries (given above). Save the file with name `Task2B.md`
- Create a "public" repository on GitHub named "Chatbot in C++"
- Upload your files to your repository
- Copy the link to your file and then submit it at this [link](https://forms.gle/1vmyin13ofkLY6Mb9) 
- DEADLINE: 2 days from the time the task is allocated

Note: I personal preference would be to begin answering the questions first then start to build chatbot but you are free to approach this task either way.

**Best submissions will be displayed as a reference for others**
